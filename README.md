Grinder speed control with stable RPM & DC power
================================================

__WORK IN PROGRESS !!!__

This project's hardware is similar to [ac_speed_control](https://github.com/speedcontrols/ac_sc_grinder), but uses PWM-based control instead of phase-based.
Key differences are:

1. Motor is powered by DC voltage (it's ok for "universal" brushed motors).
2. Direct frequency detection of current used (more precise than backEMF method).
